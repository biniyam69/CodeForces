# Codeforces Solutions 

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems. Each problem's solution is organized in a separate folder, named after the problem's ID.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
- Problem ID 1
  - Solution.cpp
  - Explanation.md
- Problem ID 2
  - Solution.py
  - Explanation.md
- ...
```

## How to Use

To access a specific problem's solution, navigate to the corresponding folder using the problem's ID. Inside each folder, you will find the solution file (e.g., Solution.cpp) and an explanation file (e.g., Explanation.md) that provides a detailed explanation of the approach and algorithm used.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions as a reference for your own learning and practice.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions are intended for educational purposes only. It is important to understand and solve problems on your own to enhance your programming skills. Using these solutions as-is without understanding them may hinder your growth as a programmer.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository by adding your own solutions or improving existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
